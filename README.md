## About me

Hi! my name is Zack. I am an aspiring software developer for the aerospace industry. I am currently majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Aviation technology. The languages that I specialize in are all the variations of C, however I am knowledgable in Python and Javascript. 

My hobbies include working on Unreal Engine 5, playing Magic the Gathering, and playing an infinite amount of video games of varying genres. The game that takes up the most of my time is Valorant, and I have a Tik Tok channel with 10k+ followers. I will post the link below just because.
